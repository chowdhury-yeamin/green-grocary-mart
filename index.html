    <h2 >Fish</h2>
    <p>Fish are aquatic animals that live in freshwater or saltwater environments, such as rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans. They are cold-blooded vertebrates, meaning they have a backbone and their body temperature varies with their surroundings. Most fish have gills for breathing, fins for swimming, and scales covering their bodies. Fish come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, ranging from tiny neon tetras to massive whale sharks.</p>

        <h2>Types of Fish</h2>
         <p>There are three main types of fish: bony fish (like salmon and trout), cartilaginous fish (such as sharks and rays), and jawless fish (like lampreys). Fish play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems, helping maintain balance by feeding on algae, insects, and other organisms. They are also an important food source for many animals and humans.</p>

        <h2>Human Culture</h2>
        <p>Fish have been a crucial part of human culture, economy, and diet for thousands of years. They are caught in the wild and raised in aquaculture farms around the world. In addition to their economic value, fish are also popular in recreational fishing and aquariums.

Because of pollution, overfishing, and climate change, many fish species face threats to their survival. Conservation efforts are essential to protect these diverse and valuable creatures.</p>
